    "## Theoretical background\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of robotics has found great success using a probabilistic approach to handle uncertainty.\n",
    "In contrast to industrial robots, which reside in controlled environments, mobile robots (the focus of this course) have to adapt to additional detrimental factors such as: dynamic environments, sensor disturbances, or unreliable movement systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core principle of this **probabilistic robotics** is to represent this uncertainty as probability distribution. In most cases we will use the observations from the environment (usually denoted as $z_n$), to estimate the most probable state ($x_n$) and how certain this prediction is ($\\Sigma_{x_n}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lesson 2, we introduce the *Gaussian distribution* (also known as Normal distribution) , given that we will use it extensively during the course.\n"
